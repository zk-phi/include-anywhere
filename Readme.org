* include-anywhere.el

Insert import statements from anywhere

どこからでもいい感じに import 文を挿入

** Description

This package provides `include-anywhere` command, which just inserts
an import statement into the "right" position, regardless of where you
are now.

"Right" position is by default determined by `string<` predicate, and
import statements will be ordered lexicographically (anyway you can
customize this behavior).
